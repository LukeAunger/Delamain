# Fina Year Project Delamain
 My Final year project was to design a booking system for the nhs that takes into account patients health


The Delamain project is the aim to develop an application to create an organized structure for patients coming into Accident and Emergency (A&E). Patients using the application will be organized into most at risk to least. Each patient will be given time to attend A&E, this will consider the patient's location geographically and how long it will take them to get to the nearest A&E site so wards will become less crowded. Each patient will have details of their current condition and any past conditions that could contribute to the severity of this situation.
